### Functions and Scope
1. Describe what a function is/does?
1. How do I declare a function? and how do I run a function?
1. Given the following code, what is the command to console log `hello world`?

  var hello = function () {
    return function () {
      return function () {
        console.log("hello world");
      };
    };
  };
  ```

1. Would the following code console.log `destroy the world`? or would it give you an error saying `b is not undefined`? Explain your answer.

  ```javascript
  var a = "hello world!";
  var myFunction = function() {
    var b = "destroy the worl!";
  }
  myFunction();
  console.log(b);
  ```

1. Would the following code console.log `25`? or would it console.log `1`? Explain your answer.

  ``` javascript
  var a = 5;
  var myFunction = function() {
    console.log(a*a);
  }
  var otherFunction = function () {
    myFunction = function() {
      console.log(a/a);
    }
  }

  otherFunction();
  myFunction();
  ```

1. What is the difference between the following code?

  ``` javascript
  function add (a) {
    return a+a;
  }

  add = function (a) {
    return a+a
  }
  ```

1. Which of these function would work, and which one would not? Explain your answer.

  ```
  console.log(a())
  console.log(b())
  function a () {return "321"}
  b = function () {return "123"}
  ```

### Objects
