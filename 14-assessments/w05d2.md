### Roman Numerals

In Ruby, write a function `transfrom` that will transform numerals to romans and vice versa

For example, given the following input:

```ruby
["III", 29, 38, "CCXCI", 1999]
```

The correct output is:

```ruby
[3, "XXIX", "XXXVIII", 291, "MCMXCIX"]
```

If you're not familiar with or need a refresher on Roman numerals, the rules are simple. First, there are seven letters associated with seven values:

```
I = 1
V = 5
X = 10
L = 50
C = 100
D = 500
M = 1000
```

You can combine letters to add values, by listing them largest to smallest from left to right:

```
II   is 2
VIII  is 8
XXXI is 31
```
