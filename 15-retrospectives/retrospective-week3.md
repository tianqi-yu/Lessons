## Retrospective Intro

#### White Hat (10 minutes)
Participants raise and discuss anything from the last iteration which can be said to be a fact or information. Hunches and feelings and any discussion of reasons or other non information based #output should be left for the appropriate hat.

#### Yellow Hat (10 minutes)
#Participants can only talk about the good things that happened in the last iteration.

#### Black Hat (10 minutes)
#Participants can only talk about the bad things that happened, any negative criticism they have or worst case scenarios they can think of.

#### Green Hat (10 minutes)
The discussion moves on to any ideas people have about solving problems or things that may add more value to the business or help in any way. Outside of the box helicopter view blue sky thinking #is encouraged.

#### Red Hat (5 Minutes)
Give the participants a short period of time in which they can come up to the board and write down 2 emotive staments each. These could be the issues that have stood out for them the most or an #idea for solving a problem. These statements should be instinctive which is why you will give them very little time to do this.
